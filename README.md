#### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Something that does not have a license is not really an open source project. A lot of programmers will not help unless there is a license along with the open source project. Than you are sharing your work with everyone else and helping benefit not just yourself, but the entire community. The reason you choose a license is it complies with the OSI so that the software can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone. The licenses protect those individuals from working on a project that they won't ever be able to use. 



##### Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license?

If there is no explicit License, than by definition "All rights resevered", which means anything you do cannot be used or distrubted(not really open source). Not helping community. Basically doing free work for an individual or company that you may not be able to share, or use for free. Helping others make a profit possibly with no help to the community or yourself really, which might bit you in the end. 


##### why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?

It is interesting, since at the time HTTP was picked, but now we are turning more towards the Gopher system. I agree with this claim, since a lot of things have changed since those were created. At the time it was probably more convenient and easier to do things through HTTP, since a there was not as many programmers back than and they probably wouldn't know what to do. Now with so many more programmers the authors of the sites can post files and create new menu files and fixing outdated links. I agree with the claim. 


##### Look at Software project and Justify why they used a certain license. 

This is the project I looked at, Canadaduane/house. They have a MIT License. This license is used, since it is extremely open and has little to no restrictions. Gives the coders helping with the project more access and reason to assist in this project. Only requirement an MIT license places on its recipients is that they keep original coders copyright notice intact when they repurpose, redistribute, or otherwise reuse original persons code. You can build a business that sells larger, proprietary applications built out of smaller, open source components without the fear of imitators purchasing and re-selling your product. 


#### Think of an example project. Pick a license
