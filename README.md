#### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

Something that does not have a license is not really an open source project. A lot of programmers will not help unless there is a license along with the open source project. Than you are sharing your work with everyone else and helping benefit not just yourself, but the entire community. The reason you choose a license is it complies with the OSI so that the software can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone. The licenses protect those individuals from working on a project that they won't ever be able to use. 



##### Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license?

If there is no explicit License, than by definition "All rights resevered", which means anything you do cannot be used or distrubted(not really open source). Not helping community. Basically doing free work for an individual or company that you may not be able to share, or use for free. Helping others make a profit possibly with no help to the community or yourself really, which might bit you in the end.
